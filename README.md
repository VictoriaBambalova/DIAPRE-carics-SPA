This project is a web application currently under development, designed to function as a digital catalog and online store for caricatures.

The platform will allow me to:

- Publish and show my latest digital caricature artworks

- Enable visitors to browse the catalog freely

- Allow users to rate artworks

- Provide the option to purchase caricatures directly through the platform

Inspiration:

The inspiration behind this project comes from my love for art, and more specifically, from my passion for creating digital caricatures to help people create personalized and sentimental gifts for their loved ones.

This project combines art and technology, turning creativity into a digital experience that connects artists and people looking for unique, heartfelt gifts.

Project Goals:

- Create a visually appealing and user-friendly web application

- Combine a digital art gallery with e-commerce functionality

- Support interaction through ratings and feedback

- Offer a simple and intuitive purchasing process

- Build a scalable foundation for future features and growth
